			<p>Mumblr is a speech training app created by a team of four for HackRU 2015.</p>
			<p>
				After entering your "crutch words" (things like "um" or "like"), just start 
				the program and your computer will emit an unpleasant noise every time it detects
				one, conditioning you to be a better, more effective speaker! 
			</p>

				MEET THE TEAM

				Adrian Garza can only be described as a "front-end ninja". His impeccable eye for design and 
				incredibly creative mind (not to mention his expertise in slant rhymes) made him an integral
				part of Mumblr's development.
			</p>
			<p>
				Amol Kapoor is a scrappy back-end developer who knows everything from Javascript to the smaller,
				more powerful Javascript of JQuery. He also owns the server, most of the language-processing code, and several
				developers' souls.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tyler Im is the surly yet charming Javascript and back-end developer. He likes baneposting and getting caught 
				in the rain.
			</p>
			<p>
				Amy Tong is pretty cool. She's 56% done with the Codecademy course on Javascript, 61% on Python and 3% on HTML/CSS.
